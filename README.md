# Green-Thumb-Website-UI
The code shown was created for a semester-long UI/UX design project for CS 422.
The entirety of the code was developed by: Simon Sazian, Ben Deschand, Tony Lau, Soham Pradhan, and Tapan Patel.
The multi-step development is shown below.

1) Brainstorming a potential problem that our project can address. Abstract shown below:
  
  Novice small-scale gardeners frequently find it difficult to create functional and aesthetic gardens that are easy to maintain and well organized.
  A lack of knowledge and experience of the varying requirements for different species and sticking to a maintenance schedule leaves many beginning gardeners 
  discouraged and unmotivated. Mainly, those with outdoor gardens intended for food consumption find difficulty dealing with direct exposure to the elements, 
  whereas gardeners with indoor plants for aesthetic purposes face the opposite obstacle of trying to replicate the proper conditions found in nature. 
  Similarly, a lack of informed decision making can typically lead to small scale gardens consisting of plants with very diverse requirements, increasing the 
  amount of effort and knowledge needed to keep the plants alive and healthy.

1) Conducting user interviews and observations to further understand potential user concerns.
   We then analyzed our interview findings by splitting all interviewees into different user classes, each with a unique set of problems, goals, and backgrounds.
   
2) Creating sketches based on a potential user scenario:

  Joe is a retired adult, who frequently enjoys keeping plants in his house and garden. One day while Joe is browsing at Home Depot, he sees a group of 
  beet sprouts that he is interested in growing. He purchases them and returns home. Once he returns home, he opens his device to the Green Thumb App and 
  sees that he needs to water today. So he searches the name of the plant beets in his MyPlants page. There, he learns more about the plant's ideal conditions; 
  the amount of water, pest and disease control. He saves the plant info on the app for easy reference later on. To check if he needs to water his newly added 
  plants today he checks back up on the watering page and sees that there is a recommendation to water the new plants so he clicks watered to mark in his history 
  that he watered the designated plants today.  He also remembers since it is winter and the humidity is very low he decided to water the plants an extra time 
  yesterday since the soil was dry so he clicks yesterday's date in the watering history and updates it to watered.

3) Creating a paper prototype based on all first sketches, and conducting 2 rounds of user testing following revisions.
  
  Briefing, which will be told to the user prior to their testing, briefly explaining the background and motivation of the 
  application and an overview of their tasks and the style of engagement:

    Our goal is to test potential user interfaces for a new application.
    The application is to help small-scale gardeners start and maintain their gardens.
    You will be asked to complete 3 simple tasks on a paper prototype of the user interface. Each task will take a maximum of 5 minutes, 
    and the entire user study should take at most 20 minutes to complete.
    We encourage you to think out loud and talk through your thoughts during the testing session, and engage in conversation with the facilitator.
    Regardless of whether you complete the tasks or not, it will give us valuable insight into our system, and we appreciate your involvement.
    During any point you are allowed to pull your consent and you are not obligated to complete the study.
  
  Scenario Tasks to be written on notecards and silently handed to the user one at a time during the prototype test:

    Add strawberry to your list of plants
    Add a strawberry plant to your existing garden
    Find how much water strawberry plants need
    Add watering to your weekly schedule

5) Beginning to develop code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with JQuery and Bootstrap libraries used).
6) Following completion of the code, heuristic evaluations were conducted on all aspects of the project for further potential expansion.
